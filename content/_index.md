# Instructions

Welcome to Ramp's frontend interview challenge.

In this challenge, you will need to fix certain bugs within the starter code provided to you.

The bugs **do not depend on each other**, so you can solve them independently.

You will submit a CodeSandbox link with your response.

### Prerequisites

- `node`
- `npm` or `yarn`
- [CodeSandbox](https://codesandbox.io)

### Coding

Since you need to submit a CodeSandbox link with your response (_See [Submission](#submission)_), we recommend that you create the CodeSandbox first, solve the bugs in your generated CodeSandbox, and then share the link with us. _You can also work locally first, and upload at the end._

#### Upload the project to CodeSandbox

**NOTE: We recommend you use this method to upload your project (with the CLI) rather than importing directly from Github to generate a CodeSandbox.**

- Run `yarn install` or `npm install`
- Run `yarn upload` or `npm run upload`
- If this is the first time using CodeSandbox CLI, it will ask you to log in with Github first
- You might be prompted: **We will upload XXX static files to your CodeSandbox upload storage** and then a list of files (typically `DS_Store` or `desktop.ini` files). It's fine if you upload with these, or you can manually remove them before uploading.
- Confirm that you want to proceed with deployment
- Once it finishes, you will get the link for your CodeSandbox. Also, you can log in to the website with your Github account and see your projects to retrieve the link.
- Start working directly on the CodeSandbox
