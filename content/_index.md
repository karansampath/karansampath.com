Hi, I'm Karan. I aim to do work that brings meaningful change. I currently work at [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) as an engineer on the Applied AI team, working to bring Claude to the world.

I've previously worked on intelligent document parsing and developer tooling at various tech companies. I hold an M.S. in Data Science and B.S.E in Networked and Social Systems, both from the University of Pennsylvania. During my time there, I served as a teaching assistant to [Zachary Ives](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~zives/) and [Swapneel Sheth](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~swapneel/), and conducted research with [Duncan Watts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_J._Watts).

A fun fact about me: I completed my high school at a boarding school in the foothills of the Himalayas. Here I learnt the value of resilience, fortitude, and self-belief. During this time I also represented India for debate, as part of a team of 5 that was selected from over 5000.

In my free time, I like to read, make and watch movies, and go on hikes. To reach out, email me at [me@karansampath.com](mailto:me@karansampath.com).
