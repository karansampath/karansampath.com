## Director Diffusion {.project-header}

*An end to end open-source package to train Low Rank Adaptations (LoRAs) of the Flux1.Krea-dev model to fit the style of famous directors. The directors chosen here are **Christopher Nolan**, **Martin Scorsese**, **Wes Anderson**, **Denis Villeneuve**, and **David Fincher**, with the code being broadly applicable.*

**Motivation / Use Case:** Helps those interested in ***film and the arts*** better understand the core elements of directorial style. In what ways is it recognizable, and what are subliminal signs? Personally, I was very interested in this due to being a fan of their work, and wanted to understand how to best develop models around them.

**Tech / Keywords:** *Python*, *Transformers*, *Torch*, *CUDA*, *Modal*, *Diffusers*, *XFormers*, *PeFT*, *Gradio*

**Repository:** [ðŸ”— GitHub](https://github.com/karansampath/director-diffusion), [Demo](https://nano-diffusion--flux-lora-gradio-gradio-app.modal.run/)
