## Tier 1: The Crown Jewels ⭐⭐⭐

1. Glacier National Park, MT: You can spend months in the stunning beauty of the lakes, glaciers, and animals here.


2. Yosemite National Park, CA: Hikes, views and valleys. I only wish it wasn't so touristed (though I guess I'm part of the problem).

3. Kenai Fjords National Park, AK: Hiked on a glacier, 10/10 experience.

## Tier 2: Exceptional Destinations ⭐⭐

4. Acadia National Park, ME: Sunrise here was an incredible experience.

5. Crater Lake National Park, OR: Come for how blue the water is, it will leave you spellbound.

6. Denali National Park, AK: Saw this in shoulder season. A stunning sight with snow all over.

## Tier 3: Worthwhile Visits ⭐

7. Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks, CA: Being in the presence of these trees made me feel spiritual.

8. Pinnacles National Park, CA: The main hike, even if singular, is well worth it for the condors on the way.

9. Shenandoah National Park, VA: Great place for rock scrambling.
