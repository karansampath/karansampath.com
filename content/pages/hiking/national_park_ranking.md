## Tier 1: The Crown Jewels

- Glacier National Park, MT: You can spend months in the stunning beauty of the lakes, glaciers, and animals here.


- Yosemite National Park, CA: Hikes, views and valleys. I only wish it wasn't so touristed (though I guess I'm part of the problem).

- Kenai Fjords National Park, AK: Hiked on a glacier, 10/10 experience.

- Haleakala National Park, HI: A cornucopia of the world's different climates and vegetation in a very small area.

## Tier 2: Timeless Beauty

- Acadia National Park, ME: Sunrise here was an incredible experience.

- Crater Lake National Park, OR: Come for how blue the water is, it will leave you spellbound.

- Denali National Park, AK: Saw this in shoulder season. A stunning sight with snow all over.

## Tier 3: Worthwhile Visits ⭐

- Sequoia & Kings Canyon National Parks, CA: Being in the presence of these trees made me feel spiritual.

- Pinnacles National Park, CA: The main hike, even if singular, is well worth it for the condors on the way.

- Shenandoah National Park, VA: Great place for rock scrambling.
