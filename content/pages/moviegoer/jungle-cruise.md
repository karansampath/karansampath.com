There is a special characteristic to a work of art that doesn’t take itself too seriously. Jungle Cruise displays this quality supremely well and ensures that regardless of its flaws, we leave the theater with a warm, fuzzy feeling in our hearts. An adventure ride is transformed into a story of mirth and enjoyment, becoming an appropriate panacea for these harsh times.

Set in the 1920s, Jungle Cruise tells the story of the journey of Dr. Lily Houghton (Emily Blunt) and her brother MacGregor Houghton (Jack Whitehall) as they search through the Amazon for the flowers of a mythical tree which can cure sickness, heal injuries and lift curses. The captain of the ship they’re on is Frank Wolff (Dwayne Johnson), and as he guides them through the rainforest, they encounter foes both ancient and contemporary - with ample time in between the action for brevity and humor, of course.

The appeal of Jungle Cruise’s script lies not in its narrative flow or coherence, but in that it clearly communicates the core ethos and emotion of the movie. There is a distinct focus on ensuring that the story is not too overbearing with background and that we are easily rescued by regular banter and comedy between the main characters. This framework ensures that the movie remains relatable and upbeat regardless of the sometimes dreary visuals and unconvincing acting. Don’t get me wrong, the script wasn’t nearly all good (not quite) and suffered from several plot holes, inexplicable time jumps, caricaturish characters, and often lazy handling of sensitive issues. The 1920s were the precursor to extremely painful and harsh events, and Jungle Cruise needed to do better while handling the allusions it makes to the era. The story also ends in a disappointing manner, seeming like it was trying to be a fairy tale when it clearly wasn’t one.

On the acting, the movie rests on the undeniable chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Emily Blunt, who riff off each other to develop an amiable atmosphere that pervades throughout the film. This was effectively portrayed in the marketing campaign for the film, where there were often more stories about their chemistry than about the film itself. However, this relationship is also taken too far by the script with an inclusion of a romantic angle which was not required at all. Johnson and Blunt aren’t naturally the most romantic pair, and hence their romantic relationship almost feels like a distraction.

Thankfully, this dour point on an otherwise wonderful on-screen pairing is masked by the show-stealing performance of Jack Whitehall as the hilariously over-the-top Englishman MacGregor Houghton. His comedic credentials shine through in his facial expressions and quips, which instantly brighten the scene and distract the audience from an often bewildering script. Personally, I love it when comedians are cast in film roles; they often know exactly what their audience wants and are able to deliver in a way that exactly meets that need.

Visually, the movie makes full use of the extensive intellectual property behind the franchise, having a theme park ride dating back to the 1950s. The costumes and CGI make the sets feel entirely realistic, and the film leverages the Amazonian surroundings with the inclusion of some truly spellbinding shots. The over $200 million budget is fully utilized with realistic visualizations, making the movie a great cinematic experience.

Ultimately, the film works best when it is true to its old-fashioned escapist roots and doesn’t half-heartedly aim for more. Whether it is MacGregor Houghton’s over-the-top campy attitude or Frank Wolff’s pun jokes, the self-aware nature of Jungle Cruise is its unique appealing quality. It’s not meant to be analyzed or taken too seriously, and is one for the laughs and light-hearted moments. I dare say we can use some of that in these times.

Jungle Cruise is available to stream on Disney Plus.
