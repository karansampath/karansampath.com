## Hiking

I'm passionate about hiking, something that was born during my time in high school in the Himalayas. Some of the peaks I've climbed:

- [Tapovan: 4460m / 14640 ft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tapovana)
- [Bedni Bugyal: 3354m / 11004 ft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedni_Bugyal)
- [Pitamakan Pass: 2481m / 8138 ft](https://www.alltrails.com/trail/us/montana/pitamakan-dawson-loop)
- [Mount Lafayette: 1600m / 5249 ft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Lafayette)

I've also compiled a [personal ranking of the national parks I've visited](/pages/hiking/national_park_ranking/) based on my experiences.
