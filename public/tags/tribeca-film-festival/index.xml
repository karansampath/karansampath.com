      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;heat-an-experience-like-no-other&#34;&gt;Heat: An Experience Like No Other&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Published on July 8, 2022&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.thepennmoviegoer.com/movie-review?author=609aeb2a0d591d31a95ccc6b&#34;&gt;Read the original article on The Penn Moviegoer&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s rare to have out-of-body experiences, and it&amp;rsquo;s even rarer to have an out-of-body experience in anticipation of the actual out-of-body experience. I had several such experiences in anticipation of the 4K UHD Restoration Premiere of action epic Heat at the Tribeca Film Festival. The anticipation was a product of both seeing a movie that came so highly recommended and also getting to see in person revered screen legends Al Pacino and Robert De Niro talk about their craft and career. And it did not disappoint. Watching them I was not only transported at once to many of my favorite films but was able to understand the deep and painstaking filmmaking process that gave us so many timeless classics.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
